### EmailtoSMS
Currently still in development, has been tested on Public Mobile, Telus, Rogers, and Koodo. 
Rogers and Koodo no longer support email to sms due to spam
100% works with Public Mobile and Telus, I have tested it myself

You have to fill out your own information in the assigned areas in the code, including a google passkey for email to sms with your account [download](https://www.google.com/account/about/passkeys/), the phone number you are sending to,
the email you are send with, and which provider you wish to use from the Provider list. 
You can switch between sending SMS and MMS messages, MMS allows you to send images, but it is currently not working, the code is there for it though. 
Use Python 3.9
